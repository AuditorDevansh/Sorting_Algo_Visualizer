 ## Bubble Sort Symphony: A Visual and Auditory Spectacle

### Dive into the Rhythmic World of Sorting

This repository presents a captivating fusion of data visualization and music, transforming the often-dry Bubble Sort algorithm into a mesmerizing audiovisual experience. By mapping data elements to musical notes, we've created an interactive journey that both educates and entertains.

### Key Features
* **Harmonious Visualization:** Watch as data is sorted, accompanied by a visually stunning and melodic representation.
* **Interactive Controls:** Easily manipulate the visualization with intuitive start, pause, and reset functions.
* **Code Clarity:** Well-structured code ensures easy understanding and customization.
* **Responsive Design:** Enjoy the experience across various devices and screen sizes.

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AuditorDevansh/SortingAlgoVisualizer.git
   ```
2. **Launch the Symphony:**
   Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to begin your musical sorting adventure.

### How the Magic Happens
We employ an array of divs to represent data elements, with their heights corresponding to values. As Bubble Sort iterates, these divs dance to the rhythm, accompanied by a harmonious melody generated from their values. The result is a dynamic interplay of sight and sound that illuminates the sorting process.

### Expanding the Musical Palette
This project is an ongoing composition. Future enhancements include:
* **Orchestral Sorting:** Introducing a variety of sorting algorithms with distinct musical themes.
* **User-Composed Symphonies:** Empowering users to create their own musical scales and tempos.
* **Interactive Composition:** Allowing users to input data and generate personalized musical sorting experiences.
* **Performance Benchmarking:** Visualizing sorting algorithm efficiency through intricate musical patterns.

### Join the Symphony
